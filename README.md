# metalsmith-s3
Metalsmith plugin for reading/writing/copying files on AWS S3.

Example usage: [nonLinear.zone build process](https://github.com/mwishek/nonlinear.build).

# Installation
```
$ npm install metalsmith-s3
```

# Usage
```node
var Metalsmith = require('metalsmith');
var s3 = require('metalsmith-s3');

var metalsmith = new Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(s3({
    action: 'copy',
    bucket: 's3-bucket-dest',
    from: 's3-bucket-src',
    prefix: ['images/', 'js/']
  }));
  .use(s3({
    action: 'read',
    bucket: 's3-bucket-src',
    ignore: ['images/', 'js/']
  }));
  ...
  .use(s3({
    action: 'write',
    bucket: 's3-bucket-dest'
  }));
```
### S3 Library Pass Through
You can pass through additional settings directly to the s3 library by adding an `s3` key and hash.
Properties available vary based on the chosen action:
  - [read](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getObject-property)
  - [copy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#copyObject-property)
  - [write](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#putObject-property)

Example to set the ACL for files written to s3:
```node
var Metalsmith = require('metalsmith');
var s3 = require('metalsmith-s3');

var metalsmith = new Metalsmith(__dirname)
  ...
  .use(s3({
    action: 'write',
    bucket: 's3-bucket-dest'
    s3: {
      ACL: 'public-read'
    }
  }));
```

If file metadata has an `s3` key, it is mixed in as well.
That allows overriding properties on a per-file basis.

Example setting ACL for specific file in front-matter:
```md
---
title: My Article
s3:
  ACL: private
---
```

### Region Override
In case you face the following error, just add the optional parameter *region* :  
``` TypeError: Error: PermanentRedirect: The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint.```  

Applicable regions are listed in [aws documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region).  
Usage example:
``` javascript
.use(s3({
  action: 'write',
  bucket: 's3-bucket-dest',
  region: 'eu-west-1'
}));
```

# Actions
### Read

The _read_ action will read files from an S3 bucket which can then be processed by plugins later in the chain. The _read_ action can be modified to ignore certain prefixes in the S3 bucket be setting the _ignore_ to a prefix, or an array of prefixes.

#### Read Parameters:

bucket: source S3 bucket  
ignore: a prefix or array of prefixes _not_ to be read from the source S3 bucket  
region: bucket's endpoint region (optional)

### Copy

The _copy_ action will copy files from a source S3 bucket to a destination S3 bucket. The _copy_ action must include a _prefix_ parameter to specifiy one or more prefixes to be processed.

#### Copy Parameters

bucket: destination S3 bucket  
from: source S3 bucket  
prefix: a prefix or array of prefixes to be copied from the source S3 bucket  
region: bucket's endpoint region (optional)

### Write

The _write_ action will write all files to the destination S3 bucket.  

#### Write Parameters

bucket: destination S3 bucket  
region: bucket's endpoint region (optional)

#### Mime Types

Uploaded file's mime type will be set by:

 * `mimeType` property in the file's meta, if set
 * type determined by [mime-type](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types)'s inspection of the file name
 * undefined (interpreted as `application/octet-stream` by S3)

# Credentials configuration

### Via environment variables
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
```

### Via configuration file

Create a credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials` on Mac/Linux or `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key
```
